        1. Write the correct answer  from the following options and give an explanation  (2-5 lines) ?  let greeting;
        greetign = {};
        console.log(greetign);                                                                                                                                                                      A: {}
            B: ReferenceError: greetign is not defined
            C: undefined

        ====> Answer : A: {}

        Explanation:
        In the provided code, the variable "greeting" is declared but not initialized. Later, "greetign" (a typo or misspelling of "greeting") is assigned an empty object {}. When you log "greetign" to the console, it will display the empty object, so the output will be "{}". Option A is the correct answer.


        2. Write the correct answer  from the following options and give an explanation  (2-5 lines) ?

         function sum(a, b) {

                return a + b;
                }

                sum(1, "2"); 
                
                A: NaN
                B: TypeError
                C: "12"
                D: 3

    ===> Answer : 
            C: "12"

            Explanation:
            In the provided code, the "sum" function takes two parameters, "a" and "b," and returns their sum. When you call the "sum" function with arguments (1, "2"), JavaScript performs type coercion and converts the number 1 to a string so that it can concatenate the two values, resulting in the string "12". Option C is the correct answer.

    3. Write the correct answer  from the following options and give an explanation  (2-5 lines) ?  

        const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
        const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };
        info.favoriteFood = "🍝";
        console.log(food);                                                                                                                                                               
        A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
        B: ['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
        C: ['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
        D: ReferenceError


    ===> Answer: 
    

    A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']

    Explanation:
    In the provided code, an array named "food" is declared and initialized with four emoji elements. Then, an object "info" is created with a property "favoriteFood" that initially references the first element of the "food" array, which is "🍕". Later, "info.favoriteFood" is reassigned to "🍝", but this does not affect the "food" array. So, when you log "food" to the console, it remains unchanged, and the output is still the original array as shown in option A.

    4.Write the correct answer  from the following options and give an explanation  (2-5 lines) ?                                
    function sayHi(name) {
    return `Hi there, ${name}`;
     }

     console.log(sayHi());                                                                                                                                                                                  A: Hi there,
        B: Hi there, undefined
        C: Hi there, null
        D: ReferenceError


    ===> Answer:
    B: Hi there, undefined

        Explanation:
        In the provided code, the "sayHi" function expects a parameter "name" to be passed when it's called. However, when you call "sayHi()" without providing an argument, the "name" parameter inside the function is undefined. Therefore, the function returns "Hi there, undefined," and option B is the correct answer.


    5. Write the correct answer  from the following options and give an explanation  (2-5 lines) ?                                    
     let count = 0;
    const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

    nums.forEach((num) => {
    if (num) count += 1;
    });

    console.log(count);                                                                                                                                                                                    A: 1
            B: 2
            C: 3
            D: 4

    ===> Answer : 

    B: 2

    Explanation:
    In the provided code, the "forEach" method is used to iterate over the elements of the "nums" array. Inside the callback function, there is a conditional check "if (num)" which evaluates to true for all elements except 0 because 0 is considered falsy in JavaScript. So, the "count" variable is incremented for every element except 0. Since there are two elements (1 and 2) in the "nums" array that are not 0, the "count" variable is incremented twice, resulting in a value of 2. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

                


    ===> 5 Project features

 .Dynamic Routing with React Router:

Dynamic routing allows you to create different paths or URLs in your React application that correspond to different views or components. React Router is a popular library for managing client-side routing in React applications. It enables you to define routes and associate them with specific components. When a user navigates to a specific route, React Router renders the associated component, making it appear as if the page has changed without a full-page reload. You can also pass parameters in the URL, allowing you to create dynamic, data-driven views.

  .State Management and Form Handling with useState:
seState is a React hook that allows you to add state to functional components.
State management is crucial for handling user interactions and maintaining the state of your application. You can use useState to manage the state of form inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other interactive elements in your application. When a user interacts with a form input, the state is updated using the setState function returned by useState. This causes the component to re-render with the updated state. For example, when a user types text into an input field, the value of that field is stored in state, making it accessible for submission or further processing. Additionally, you can use useState for error handling and validation in forms. By storing error messages in state, you can display them to the user based on the validation results.

 .Loader Component for Asynchronous Operations:
A loader component is a user interface element that provides feedback to the user while an asynchronous operation is in progress. Asynchronous operations can include data fetching from an API, processing large files, or performing time-consuming calculations. The loader typically includes a visual indicator, such as a spinning spinner or a progress bar, to inform the user that something is happening in the background. To implement a loader, you can use state management with the useState hook. You maintain a boolean state variable that determines whether the loader should be displayed or hidden. When an asynchronous operation begins, you set the state variable to "true," and when it completes, you set it back to "false."

 . User Registration and Login:

  Implement user registration and login functionality using Firebase Authentication. Allow users to sign up with their email and password or sign in with their existing credentials.
    Use Firebase to securely store user authentication data, including email and password hashes.
    After successful authentication, users should be able to access their personalized content and data.

  . Private Routes and Authorization:

    Create a system of private routes that are accessible only to authenticated users. This ensures that certain parts of your application are protected and can only be accessed by logged-in users.
    Implement role-based authorization if needed, distinguishing between regular users and administrators. Admins should have access to additional features and data.
    When an unauthenticated user attempts to access a private route, they should be redirected to the login page or shown an error message, ensuring that unauthorized access is restricted.
